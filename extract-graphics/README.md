**These scripts are becoming obsolete!**

The next version (1.17.8 or 1.18.0) of PyMuPDF will support this feature directly via a new method of class ``Page`` - probably called ``Page.getDrawings()``.

It will work for **_all document types_** - not only PDF. At the same time, draw command detection will be more reliable and precise.

So stay tuned.
