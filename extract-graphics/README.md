**These scripts are becoming obsolete!**

The next version 1.17.8 of PyMuPDF will support this features directly via a new method of class ``Page`` - probably ``Page.getDrawings()``.

It will work for **_all document types_** - not only PDF. At the same time, draw command detection will be more reliable and precise.

So stay tuned.
